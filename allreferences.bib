  abstract = {The transformation in the field of marketing from the past to the present is quite remarkable. In short, this transformation can be summarized as follows: ``Marketing 1.0'' approach, which is expressed as product-centric marketing; then ``Marketing 2.0'' approach, which considers customer requests and expectations and is based on consumer-centered marketing; and followed by ``Marketing 3.0'' approach, which is based on human-centered marketing. The last stage of the change in marketing activities is ``Marketing 4.0'' applications. While this journey that started with Marketing 1.0 continues with Marketing 4.0, the concept of omnichannel marketing ranks high among the prominent concepts in this process. Omnichannel marketing applications, which overlap well with Marketing 4.0 applications and create the opportunity to bring together all the online and offline assets of businesses, enables not only physical communication channels but also web-based channels to be used in critical marketing areas such as finding customers and creating customer loyalty. Many of today's modern businesses consider these practices as an important marketing strategy that will provide competitive advantage over competitors. In this study, it is aimed to provide detailed information about Marketing 4.0 implementations during the transition from traditional marketing to digital marketing. With this aim, some conceptual information about omnichannel marketing activities have been given, examples of brands which present omnichannel marketing experience both in Turkey and in the world have been presented, and some proposals have been given for better competitive strategies for the companies in today's competitive environment. To achieve these goals, the literature review method was used in the study.},

  abstract = {Elon Musk, one of the richest individuals in the world, is considered a technological visionary and has a social network of over 69 million followers on social media platform Twitter. He regularly uses his social media presence to communicate on various topics, one of which is cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Dogecoin. Using an event study approach, we analyze to what extent Musk's Twitter activity affects short-term cryptocurrency returns and volume. In other words, we investigate whether cryptocurrency markets exhibit a ``Musk Effect''. Based on a sample of 47 cryptocurrency-related Twitter events, we identify significant positive abnormal returns and trading volume following such events. However, we discover that on average, price effects are only significant for Dogecoin-related Tweets but not for Bitcoin. This is because regarding the latter, the significant price effects of positive and negative news cancel each other out, as further classification and analysis of Bitcoin-related tweets reveals. Our study shows the significant impact that the social media activity of influential individuals can have on cryptocurrencies. This suggests a conflict between the ideals of freedom of speech, morals and investor protection.},

  abstract = {Social media is becoming one of the main sources of unstructured data. Many financial analysts use Twitter to gather data and obtain meaningful insights. Recently, high-profile politicians like President Trump have been using Twitter to communicate with the public. The President's Tweets are used as considered to be informative signals that may influence consumers and affect investors' decisions in the stock market. The effect of these signals can be measured by coinciding changes in the stock market or changes in the share prices of certain companies targeted in the President's Tweets. The Tweets used in this research include keywords that are related to finance and economics, public policy, political considerations, and targeted companies. Event study methodology is used to determine the relationship between Trump's Tweets' content and daily changes in major indexes and targeted companies' excess returns. Although many of the recent discussions have indicated that Trump's microblogging can affect the financial markets, the results, on average, show no significant effect of Trump's Tweets on either market indexes nor on most of the targeted companies share prices.},

  abstract = {Today, people provide information through different channels. The information channels used can affect the decision-making mechanism due to asymmetric information or different tendencies. Especially in recent years, people use social media to reach information quickly. Therefore, notifications made on social media reveal economic results. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies intended to be used as currency. Unlike their traditional financial rivals, cryptocurrencies are not backed by a central bank or authority. The success of cryptocurrencies depends on its infrastructure, the block chain. Especially in recent years, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has increased. After the popularization of cryptocurrencies, digital currencies are discussed more especially in the media. In addition to the positive features, negative features are also included in the media. There are concerns about the misuse of cryptocurrencies. It is mentioned that cryptocurrencies provide financing for criminal organizations and are used in money laundering. In addition to these, it is reported that cryptocurrencies are used for tax evasion. The lack of intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies puts investors in trouble in terms of investment and price determination. Cryptocurrencies, which are digital currencies, have many digital price determinants such as social media. Two different objectives were determined in this study. The first is the detection of the presence of bubbles in Dodgecoin prices. The second is the examination of the relationship between bubbles and tweeter notifications. In the study, Dodgecoin prices between May 2020 and May 2021 are examined with the GSADF test. From May 2020 until May 2021, 10 different price bubbles are observed. Some bubbles can be associated with tweets by Elon Musk. However, the biggest bubble observed, the April 2021 price bubble, is due to a different reason.},

In an age with an abundance of details and advertising, the celebrities ` glamour has the power to increase the advertised product's exposure and to attract the attention of the consumer. Several researches have focused on analyzing the impact of celebrity endorsement on the success of brands by pointing out the importance of the match between the celebrities' personality and the image of the endorsed brand. Besides the positive aspects, there have been also pointed out the different disadvantages of using celebrities in advertising such as the overshadowing effect or the exaggerated costs involved. The results of our quantitative research have shown that, although there is not a high declared interest in celebrity endorsement, it has a role especially in shaping the social status of the consumer and that women are more attracted by celebrity endorsed product in comparison to men. :},
