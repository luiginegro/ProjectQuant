## Elon Musk's tweets make Bitcoin price skyrocket

" Bitcoin’s structure is very ingenious. The paper money disappears, and crypto-currencies are a much better way to transfer values than a piece of paper, that’s for sure "

""I think bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people"

## EDA: Popularity

Exploiting twitter APIs, Tesla's CEO tweets from 2011 to 2021 were extracted. The following variables were used as proxy to investigate Elon Musks's growing popularity: number of *retweets*, number of *likes* and number of *replies* per year, together with a comparison with the total tweets activity. Results are shown in the following chart:

```{r fi1s, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig1}Elon's twitter interaction over time"}
#plot
tweets <- ggplot(data = tweets_year, aes(x = yr, y = tweet)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = "dodge", fill = "purple", color = "black") + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of tweets")  +
  ggtitle("Tweets per year") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal()

likes <- ggplot(data = likes_year, aes(x = yr, y = nlikes)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = "dodge", fill = "darkorange", color = "black") + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of likes")  +
  ggtitle("Likes per year") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal()

retweets <- ggplot(data =retweet_year, aes(x = yr, y = nretweets), color ="darkorange") + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = "dodge", fill = "dark green", color = "black") + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of retweets") +  
   ggtitle("Retweets per year") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal()

replies <- ggplot(data = nreplies_year, aes(x = yr, y = nreplies)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = "dodge", fill ="dark red", color ="black") + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of replies")  +  
   ggtitle("Replies per year") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal()

ggarrange(tweets, likes, retweets, replies, 
          ncol = 2, nrow = 2)

```


## Crypto-related tweets

Consequently, we compare how Elon Musk's audience react to different type of tweets containing respectevely words related only to *dogecoin*, *Bitcoin* and *cypto*. The same proxies as before have been used.


```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig2}Crypto-related content interaction"}
#plotting 

dfactivity %>%
  gather(key, value, -Total) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Total, y=value, fill = key)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Bitcoin trend

Which is the width of Bitcoin price volatility once a crypto-related tweets is published? We managed to extract the tweets which only cointained the words *bitcoin* and *crypto* and connected their time-stamp to the Bitcoin market capitalization trend. The pink points on the graphic represent the moment in time when a crpyto-related tweet was published

```{r fig3, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7,fig.height=6,fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig3}BTC price compared with crypto-related tweets' date"}
btc_hist %>%
ggplot(aes(x = timestamp, y = open)) +
geom_line() + 
geom_point(data = . %>% filter(tweet == TRUE), color = "deeppink", size = 3) +
ggtitle("Elon Musk's Tweets and Bitcoin Volatility") +
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal()

```
