## Elon Musk's tweets make Bitcoin price skyrocket

" Bitcoin’s structure is very ingenious. The paper money disappears, and crypto-currencies are a much better way to transfer values than a piece of paper, that’s for sure "

""I think bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people"

## Dive deep into data

We recovered data from API tweets and obtained this

Table nlikes,nreplies,rretwets

## Slide 2

As we can see there is an increasing trend throughout the years in Elon Musks's popularity, as the numbers of likes, retweeets and replies increased by a factor of 18 in 10 years.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
ggplot(data = likes_year, aes(x = yr, y = nlikes)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = "dodge", fill = "darkorange") + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of likes")  +
  labs(fill = "Isic Code")  +  
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(direction = -1)
ggplot(data =retweet_year, aes(x = yr, y = nretweets), color ="darkorange") + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = "dodge", fill = "chartreuse") + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of retweets") +  
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(direction = -1)
ggplot(data = nreplies_year, aes(x = yr, y = nreplies)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, position = "dodge", fill ="red") + 
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of replies")  +  
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(direction = -1)
```


## Slide with Bullets
Subsetting the tweets in the ones containing crpyo and bitcoin and connecting them to the bitcoin value trend we obtain: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
btc_hist %>%
ggplot(aes(x = timestamp, y = open)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(data = . %>% filter(tweet == TRUE), color = "deeppink", size = 3)

```


## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
