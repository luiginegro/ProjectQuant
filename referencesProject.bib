  abstract = {The transformation in the field of marketing from the past to the present is quite remarkable. In short, this transformation can be summarized as follows: ``Marketing 1.0'' approach, which is expressed as product-centric marketing; then ``Marketing 2.0'' approach, which considers customer requests and expectations and is based on consumer-centered marketing; and followed by ``Marketing 3.0'' approach, which is based on human-centered marketing. The last stage of the change in marketing activities is ``Marketing 4.0'' applications. While this journey that started with Marketing 1.0 continues with Marketing 4.0, the concept of omnichannel marketing ranks high among the prominent concepts in this process. Omnichannel marketing applications, which overlap well with Marketing 4.0 applications and create the opportunity to bring together all the online and offline assets of businesses, enables not only physical communication channels but also web-based channels to be used in critical marketing areas such as finding customers and creating customer loyalty. Many of today's modern businesses consider these practices as an important marketing strategy that will provide competitive advantage over competitors. In this study, it is aimed to provide detailed information about Marketing 4.0 implementations during the transition from traditional marketing to digital marketing. With this aim, some conceptual information about omnichannel marketing activities have been given, examples of brands which present omnichannel marketing experience both in Turkey and in the world have been presented, and some proposals have been given for better competitive strategies for the companies in today's competitive environment. To achieve these goals, the literature review method was used in the study.},

  abstract = {Elon Musk, one of the richest individuals in the world, is considered a technological visionary and has a social network of over 69 million followers on social media platform Twitter. He regularly uses his social media presence to communicate on various topics, one of which is cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Dogecoin. Using an event study approach, we analyze to what extent Musk's Twitter activity affects short-term cryptocurrency returns and volume. In other words, we investigate whether cryptocurrency markets exhibit a ``Musk Effect''. Based on a sample of 47 cryptocurrency-related Twitter events, we identify significant positive abnormal returns and trading volume following such events. However, we discover that on average, price effects are only significant for Dogecoin-related Tweets but not for Bitcoin. This is because regarding the latter, the significant price effects of positive and negative news cancel each other out, as further classification and analysis of Bitcoin-related tweets reveals. Our study shows the significant impact that the social media activity of influential individuals can have on cryptocurrencies. This suggests a conflict between the ideals of freedom of speech, morals and investor protection.},

Recent research and practice indicate that such information can be interesting for the decision-making process. Questions about how and to what extent research on data mining in the financial sector has developed and which tools are used for these purposes remains largely unexplored. This study aims to answer three research questions: (i) What is the intellectual core of the field? (ii) Which techniques are used in the financial sector for textual mining, especially in the era of the Internet, big data, and social media? (iii) Which data sources are the most often used for text mining in the financial sector, and for which purposes? In order to answer these questions, a qualitative analysis of literature is carried out using a systematic literature review, citation and co-citation analysis.},

Triggering mechanism of such events can be economic or political conditions and ideological or religious divides. In recent years we have seen social media (facebook, tweeter etc.) play an increasing role in organizing protests and disseminating information to a broader base, therefore magnifying the potential fallout for a city. From the Arab Spring in Egypt to the riots in England, Turkey and Ferguson/Baltimore in the US social media were used by various groups to expand the civil unrest, with the government in certain cases taking the unprecedented measure of blocking social media. In response to such social media use emergency responders are now trying to monitor such platforms to allow for an effective response to potential violent actions.The paper focuses on the use of social media in triggering civil unrest and the short and long-term effects for cities/countries and their hotel industry. A combination of socioeconomic and hotel performance indicators [Average-Daily-Rate (ADR) and Revenue-Per-Available-Room (RevPAR) for luxury, mid-price and economy hotels] are used to assess the effect of such events in recent years. The preliminary results suggest that more intense civil unrest even within a short period of time has lasting effects for cities as well as the luxury hotels. Longer unrests have additional spillover effects among mid-price hotels.},

This study traces the reactions to this event from Thai social network users of Twitter and Facebook. Design/methodology/approach: The core data for analysis were tweets from hash tag \#Thaiflood and messages posted in Thaiflood Facebook. This study constructed a content analysis platform for collecting data from each selected tweet and post during the period of flooding from September 25, 2012 to October 10, 2012. Findings: The findings principally describe the reaction patterns of posts on Facebook and tweets by twitter. These reactions are presented statistically to provide debt-details in user behavior. They conclude, for example, that on Facebook females (58.4\%) are more concerned than males about floods; and on tweeter, messages on flooding were tweeted by only 25.1\%, of which many re-tweeted. Practical implications: If possible, government should consider these social networks as a critical tool example in a disaster management plan. This would help in responding immediately to an event, and assist in reducing damage. Originality/value: This study explains interaction between the social network and disaster phenomenon.

For example, victims, emergency responders, and others took to Twitter to share information about conditions, aid, resources and the like in the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. The current paper concerns how a re-tweet count, or the number of others who have already forwarded a message, influences people's spreading of disaster-related tweets. The results of a human-subjects experiment revealed that, when the re-tweet count of a tweet increased, the likelihood that people would share the tweet increased when it came from an individual's account, but the likelihood decreased when it came from a news agency's account. These social influences disappeared when the re-tweet counts were over 1000 people. These findings extend the understanding of how disaster-related information spreads on social media, which is essential for improving social media during disaster management.},

All known forecasting methods based on social media have failed when subjected to the demands of true forward-looking electoral forecasting. These failures appear to be due to fundamental properties of social media, rather than to methodological or algorithmic difficulties. In short, social media do not, and probably never will, offer a stable, unbiased, representative picture of the electorate; and convenience samples of social media lack sufficient data to fix these problems post hoc. Hence, while these services may, as others in this volume discuss, offer new ways of reaching prospective voters, the data that they generate will not replace polling as a means of assessing the sentiment or intentions of the electorate.},

Consumers exposed to brand as the source conditions indicated no difference in corporate credibility and brand attitude regardless of product-placement types. In contrast, consumers exposed to Instagram influencer as the source conditions indicated higher corporate credibility and more positive attitude toward brand posts when exposed to the influencer-with-product conditions than when exposed to the product-only conditions.

Recently, high-profile politicians like President Trump have been using Twitter to communicate with the public. The President's Tweets are used as considered to be informative signals that may influence consumers and affect investors' decisions in the stock market. The effect of these signals can be measured by coinciding changes in the stock market or changes in the share prices of certain companies targeted in the President's Tweets. The Tweets used in this research include keywords that are related to finance and economics, public policy, political considerations, and targeted companies. Event study methodology is used to determine the relationship between Trump's Tweets' content and daily changes in major indexes and targeted companies' excess returns. Although many of the recent discussions have indicated that Trump's microblogging can affect the financial markets, the results, on average, show no significant effect of Trump's Tweets on either market indexes nor on most of the targeted companies share prices.},

By using a cryptocurrency-specific lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach, financial data and bilateral Granger-causality testing, it was found that Twitter sentiment has predictive power for the returns of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Using a bullishness ratio, predictive power is found for EOS and TRON. Finally, a heuristic approach is developed to discover that at least 1\textendash 14\% of the obtained Tweets were posted by Twitter ``bot'' accounts.

Sentiment analysis papers are scattered to multiple publication venues, and the combined number of papers in the top-15 venues only represent ca. 30\% of the papers in total. We present the top-20 cited papers from Google Scholar and Scopus and a taxonomy of research topics.

The current study examines Twitter reactions to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalist's (ICIJ) publication of the Panama Papers. The analysis illustrates that there was a Twitter reaction: furthermore, that there were different styles of response and that certain styles were more likely to elicit an audience reaction, especially if the tweeter was a journalist or organization. While the provided analysis focuses on step \#2 within the social accountability process, the results imply that publicly-interested accounting academics qua activists can facilitate social accountability by helping to make previously-private financial information public and by cultivating sympathetic individuals within the traditional media as well as within organizations that are active on social media.},

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies intended to be used as currency. Unlike their traditional financial rivals, cryptocurrencies are not backed by a central bank or authority. The success of cryptocurrencies depends on its infrastructure, the block chain. Especially in recent years, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has increased. After the popularization of cryptocurrencies, digital currencies are discussed more especially in the media. In addition to the positive features, negative features are also included in the media. There are concerns about the misuse of cryptocurrencies. It is mentioned that cryptocurrencies provide financing for criminal organizations and are used in money laundering. In addition to these, it is reported that cryptocurrencies are used for tax evasion. The lack of intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies puts investors in trouble in terms of investment and price determination. Cryptocurrencies, which are digital currencies, have many digital price determinants such as social media. Two different objectives were determined in this study. The first is the detection of the presence of bubbles in Dodgecoin prices. The second is the examination of the relationship between bubbles and tweeter notifications. In the study, Dodgecoin prices between May 2020 and May 2021 are examined with the GSADF test. From May 2020 until May 2021, 10 different price bubbles are observed. Some bubbles can be associated with tweets by Elon Musk. However, the biggest bubble observed, the April 2021 price bubble, is due to a different reason.},

In an age with an abundance of details and advertising, the celebrities ` glamour has the power to increase the advertised product's exposure and to attract the attention of the consumer. Several researches have focused on analyzing the impact of celebrity endorsement on the success of brands by pointing out the importance of the match between the celebrities' personality and the image of the endorsed brand. Besides the positive aspects, there have been also pointed out the different disadvantages of using celebrities in advertising such as the overshadowing effect or the exaggerated costs involved. The results of our quantitative research have shown that, although there is not a high declared interest in celebrity endorsement, it has a role especially in shaping the social status of the consumer and that women are more attracted by celebrity endorsed product in comparison to men. :},

Given this important role, real-time analysis of social media contents to locate, organize and use valuable information for disaster management is crucial. In this paper, we propose self-learning algorithms that, with minimal supervision, construct a simple bag-of-words model of information expressed in the news about various natural disasters. Such a model is human-understandable, human-modifiable and usable in a real-time scenario. Since tweets are a different category of documents than news, we next propose a model transfer algorithm, which essentially refines the model learned from news by analyzing a large unlabeled corpus of tweets. We show empirically that model transfer improves the predictive accuracy of the model. We demonstrate empirically that our model learning algorithm is better than several state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms. Finally, we present an online algorithm that learns the weights for words in the model and demonstrate the efficacy of the model with word weights.},

Our analysis reveals several groups of emotional markers, such as general and specific, direct and indirect, which relate differently to the dynamics of returns.},

Additionally, with the profit potential in trading stocks, it is of no surprise that a number of popular financial websites are attempting to capture investor sentiment by providing an aggregate of this negative and positive online emotion. We question if the existence of dishonest posters are capitalizing on the popularity of the boards by writing sentiment in line with their trading goals as a means of influencing others, and therefore undermining the purpose of the boards. We exclude these posters to determine if predictability increases, but find no discernible difference.},

  abstract = {The massive amount of data generated by social media present a unique opportunity for disaster analysis. As a leading social platform, Twitter generates over 500 million Tweets each day. Due to its real-time characteristic, more agencies employ Twitter to track disaster events to make a speedy rescue plan. However, it is challenging to build an accurate predictive model to identify disaster Tweets, which may lack sufficient context due to the length limit. In addition, disaster Tweets and regular ones can be hard to distinguish because of word ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a sentiment-aware contextual model named SentiBERT-BiLSTM-CNN for disaster detection using Tweets. The proposed learning pipeline consists of SentiBERT that can generate sentimental contextual embeddings from a Tweet, a Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layer with attention, and a 1D convolutional layer for local feature extraction. We conduct extensive experiments to validate certain design choices of the model and compare our model with its peers. Results show that the proposed SentiBERT-BiLSTM-CNN demonstrates superior performance in the F1 score, making it a competitive model in Tweets-based disaster prediction.},
